Welcome to **_Coupon Vault's_** Headless Promotion Engine documentation! Our promotion engine allows merchants to create and manage various types of promotions, including dynamic and static coupon codes. With our flexible and scalable promotion engine, merchants can set specific rules and conditions for generating dynamic coupon codes, while creating bulk static coupon codes with the ability to set limits on usage, expiration dates, and customer eligibility. Our engine empowers merchants with greater flexibility, control, and customization options when it comes to creating and managing promotions for their e-commerce businesses.
